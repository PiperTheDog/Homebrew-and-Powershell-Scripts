# ðŸš€ Brew Installation Scripts

This repository contains two scripts to install the suite of applications I use daily:

- **`brew.sh`** â†’ Installs Homebrew (if not already installed) and then installs the apps.
- **`Brewfile`** â†’ Requires Homebrew to be installed and installs apps using `brew bundle`.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Usage Instructions

### Run this command to download and run the bash script. This will install all required apps and have your Mac ready for use in no time!

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiperTheDog/Homebrew-and-Powershell-Scripts/main/brew.sh)"
