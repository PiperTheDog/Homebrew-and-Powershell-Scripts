# ðŸš€ Brew Installation Scripts

This repository contains two scripts to install the suite of applications I use daily:

- **`brew.sh`** â†’ Installs Homebrew (if not already installed) and then installs the apps.
- **`Brewfile`** â†’ Requires Homebrew to be installed and installs apps using `brew bundle`.
