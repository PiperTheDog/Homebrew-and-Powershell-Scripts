# ðŸš€ Brew Installation Scripts

This repo contains a series of files that can be used to download all of the apps I use daily on my MacBook in one command. 
Curl is used because MacBooks do not have WGET installed by default like Linux.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Usage Instructions

### Run this command to download and run the bash script. This will install all required apps and have your Mac ready for use in no time!

```bash
sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiperTheDog/Homebrew-and-Powershell-Scripts/main/brew.sh)"
bash
